My name is Nick. I am learning the skills necessary to become a Data Analyst. Currently, I am enrolled in the Data Scientist: Analyst Career Path at Codecademy and have completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. In my free time, I enjoy watching TV and movies, trying new restaraunts, and spending time with friends.
